# Simple-Python-Calculator
A Simple Python Calculator Written In Python Because Why Not.

# Files Included In The File Directory Of Where Everything Is.
Here is what the files do

1. "Install Python.bat"
The File Is A Program Written In "Batch Script", The Coding Language For .bat Files.
It Is Made To Open The Python Installer Imbedded into the program.
2. "Main.py"
The File Is The Calculator It's Self, It Requires "Python" To Be Installed On The Host's Computer.
It Is The Main Program Doing All Of The Calculating.
3. "Readme.txt"
It's Just A Plain Text File Containing The Following Text "Thanks For Downloading! If you Don't Have Python Installed Run "Install Python.bat". Then go ahead and run the shortcut located on the desktop thats includes the word "Calculator" and have fun.
4. "README.md"
This is the file you are currently reading.
5. "python-3.10.8-amd64.exe"
See The Last Question Of The "Questions You Guys Never Asked Me." Section. It Explains What It Is, Why It's There, Why May Not Work, And Where Its From.
6. ".vscode" folder
I Just Made VSCode Spellcheck Plugin Ignore The "Incorrectly Spelt Dark".

You Won't Download A Folder With All The Files, And Rather An Installer So It's More Friendly To Idiots Then A Bunch Of Files Which Could Appear As A "vIrUs" To Them. If You Want To Download The Folder With All Of The Stuff In The Releases Choose To Download The **Source Code** Instead Of The **spc-{Version}-setup.exe** Installer.

# How Do I Know If I Have Python Or Not
I Don't Know How To Check For MAC but for windows Press The Windows Key, Type "Apps" And Select **Apps & Features**. After That Type In The Search Bar **Python**, If it Is Not There  It Isn't Installed, If It Is There It Is Installed.

Why I Didn't Just Say Press Windows Key And Search Python Is Because It Might Not Be In Quick Access Programs, So The **Apps & Features** Checks The Entire Computer For Programs And Lists Them And Vague Details On Them.

# ChangeLog (spc-0.4)
+Added A Bunch Of Circle Math Stuff
+Added Square Root
+/- Revamp (Better Text UI)

# Questions That You Guys Never Asked Me.
Q: What Do You Write Your Code In.
A: I Use Virtual Studio Code (VSCode). I also use different plugins to help my code not look like a freaking abomination

Q: Why Do You Even Code This Python Calculator If There Already Is A Windows App "Calculator" And A Downloadable Or Implemented Calculator App For Mac  (Ive Never Used Linux So Idk How That Would Work.)
A: Because It's A Fun Project To Help Get Me Going On Coding, Soon I'm Going To Be Moving To More Advanced Coding Languages. Just A Fun Project I Work On Because "I Play To Much Games" And I Wanted To Do It Anyways.

Q: It's A Virus There Is A .exe File.
A: It's Not A Virus. If You Found A File Named "python-3.10.8-amd64.exe" Thats A 64bit Python Installer. It's Required That Python Is Installed Because The Calculator Is Written In Python. If It Didn't Work For You Your Operating System Is Probably 32bit. In That Case Download A 32bit Installer From The Official Python Site. (The ""python-3.10.8-amd64.exe" is An Python Installer Downloaded From The Official Python Site With The Version 3.10.8. I will not be updating the installer. )
